# Style transfer
## Goal: implement a tool changing style of a provided text.

## Sources:

Cross-Alignment

Feature-Moverâ€™s Distance

## Progress:
1. Implemented data downloading (imdb) that will later be used for training. (17.07.19)
2. Changed code in language-style-transfer from python2 to python3. (17.07.19)
3. Found out how to run language-style-transfer code (python3.6 and tensorflow==1.3.0). Added casting to tf.int32 to 
fix a bug. (19.07.19)

## TODO:
1. Run this code (write requirements file / docker) on some corpora.
