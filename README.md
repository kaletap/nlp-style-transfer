# Style transfer
## Goal: implement a tool changing style of a provided text.

## Sources:
* Style Transfer from Non-Parallel Text by
Cross-Alignment 
    * Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09655.pdf
    * Code: https://github.com/shentianxiao/language-style-transfer

* Adversarial Text Generation via
Feature-Moverâ€™s Distance 
    * Paper: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7717-adversarial-text-generation-via-feature-movers-distance.pdf
    * Code: https://github.com/shentianxiao/language-style-transfer [1]

## Progress:
1. Implemented data downloading (imdb) that will later be used for training. (17.07.19)
2. Changed code in language-style-transfer from python2 to python3. (17.07.19)
3. Found out how to run language-style-transfer code (python3.6 and tensorflow==1.3.0). Added casting to tf.int32 to 
fix a bug. (19.07.19)
4. Fixed some other bugs in language-style-transfer regarding running
   script, created running instructions in readme. Downloaded and tested
   model according to instructions in readme created by authors
   (`python3.6 style_transfer.py --online_testing
   ../data/yelp/sentiment.test --output ../tmp/sentiment.test --vocab
   ../model/yelp.vocab --model ../model/model --load_model true --beam
   8`). It's possible to run this model in interactive mode: after
   writing <num> <sentence> it turns out it outputs translation to
   similar sentence and sentence with style transfer. It is not that
   good, especially considering that I use model pretrained by authors.

## TODO:
1. Run chainger-fm-gan code (write requirements file / docker) on some
   corpora.
